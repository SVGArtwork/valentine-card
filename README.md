# Valentine Digital Card

Valentine Digital Card is an interactive illustration created as a Progressive Web App, built around an inline SVG illustration animated and controlled via JavaScript.

The project started as a simple illustration to celebrate Valentine’s Day, but gradually turned into a small experiment on the relationship between drawing, time, and interaction.  
It is not a video, it is not a GIF: the illustration remains an illustration, but it gains movement, rhythm, and surprise.

## Drawing, Time, and Interaction  
### An interactive SVG illustration project between experience and education

## The Origin of the Project

The idea was not to create a traditional frame-by-frame animation, nor to delegate the result to an automatic tool.

The goal was to preserve:
- full graphic control over the illustration  
- code readability  
- a lightweight, open, and inspectable technology  

The illustration is therefore drawn as inline SVG, and the animation emerges directly from the code: trajectories, rotations, rhythms, and micro-variations are calculated in real time.

## Process and the Role of AI

The project was developed through a continuous dialogue between artistic choices and technical solutions.

The AI did not generate the idea nor the illustration, but it played a fundamental role as a technical collaborator:
- support in developing JavaScript animations  
- reasoning about code structure and animation resets  
- progressive iterations, corrections, and refinements  

The work did not start from a perfect request, but from small steps, doubts, and continuous adjustments.  
In this sense, the AI acted as a shared thinking tool, not as a creative substitute.

## Notes

The project is conceived as a visual experience first, rather than a technical demo.  
It works best when observed calmly, allowing the illustration to “happen” over time.
